Blood banks are the storage unit where blood of various groups are stored in bulk. Blood is received from blood donors and is preserved in a suitable environment in the blood banks. Everytime blood is needed for a treatment procedure, the blood bank comes into action.Our project aims to develop a system that provides a well managed approach to help blood banks manage the collection and distribution of blood and keep proper track of it. Using the system, blood banks can keep records of available blood stock and can keep the record of blood donors for future use. The user interface is friendly and easy to use.
